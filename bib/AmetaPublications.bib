	abstract = {A new mathematical model for representing geometric tolerances is applied to a part with an angled face and is extended to show its sensitivity to different specifications for dimensioning and tolerancing the part. The model is compatible with the {ASME/ISO} Standards for geometric tolerances. Central to the new model is a Tolerance-Map® , a hypothetical volume of points that corresponds to all possible locations and variations of a segment of a plane which can arise from tolerances on size, position, form, and orientation. Every Tolerance-Map is a convex set. This model is one part of a bi-level model that we are developing for geometric tolerances. The new model makes stackup relations apparent in an assembly, and these can be used to allocate size and orientational tolerances; the same relations also can be used to identify sensitivities for these tolerances. All stackup relations can be met for 100\% interchangeability or for a specified probability. This paper develops several Tolerance-Maps for a part with an angled end face for different tolerance specifications. These specifications are linear size, angularity, angular size, “linear size \& angularity” and “linear \& angular size” tolerance. Comparison of Tolerance-Maps for their content for these specifications led to the following conclusions: a) only angular size tolerance is not sufficient for tolerancing an angled face; b) if the value of tolerance remains the same, the allowable variation is more in a part having only an angularity tolerance than in one having only a size tolerance.},

The central element of the new math model is the Tolerance-Map®  (T-Map® ); it is the range of points resulting from a one-to-one mapping from all the variational possibilities of a feature, within its tolerance-zone, to a specially designed Euclidean point-space. A functional T-Map represents both the acceptable range of 1-D clearance and the acceptable limits to the 3-D variational possibilities of the target face consistent with it. An accumulation T-Map represents all the accumulated 3-D variational possibilities of the target which arise from allowable manufacturing variations on the individual parts in the assembly. The geometric shapes of the accumulation and functional maps are used to compute a measure of all variational possibilities of manufacture of the parts which will give each value of clearance. The measures are then arranged as a probability density function over the acceptable range of clearance, and a beta distribution is fitted to it. The method is applied to two examples.},

A new mathematical model for representing geometric tolerances is applied to a point-line cluster of features that is used to align adjacent parts in two-dimensional space. First, tolerance-zones are described for the point-line cluster. Then, a Tolerance-Map® , a hypothetical volume of points, is established which is the range of a mapping from all possible locations for the features in the cluster. A picture frame assembly of four parts is used to illustrate the accumulations of manufacturing variations, and the T-Maps provide stackup relations that can be used to allocate size and orientational tolerances. This model is one part of a bi-level model that we are developing for geometric tolerances. At the local level the model deals with the permitted variations in a tolerance zone, while at the global level it interrelates all the frames of reference on a part or assembly.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, almost every family has one electric rice cooker, thus making electric rice cooker one of the most popular household appliance in our society. If the product is not designed ecologically and is used heavily, then the product may lead to large ecological impact to our environment. To assess a product’s environmental impacts, Life Cycle Assessment ({LCA)} methodology is utilized. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, for one such technology (electric rice cooker), no complete {LCA} studies have existed by far. Therefore, the question about the electric rice cooker’s environmental performance is still open. This paper presents an {LCA} study for the complete life cycle of an electric rice cooker with the power {500Watts} as the functional unit. In order to conduct {LCA} study, the whole life cycle of electric rice cooker was divided into four primary phases: raw materials acquisition, product manufacturing, product utilization and final disposal. To facilitate the data collection and {LCA} implementation, the whole life cycle system was classified as two subsystems — background system and foreground system. Based on the proposed method, primary data and environmental impact calculation was aided by Simapro 7.2 software. In the light of the Ecoindicator-99 methodology, eleven impact categories (Carcinogens, Resp. organics, Resp. inorganics, Climate change, Radiation, Ozone layer, Ecotoxicity, Acidification, Land use, Minerals, Fossil fuels) were used for the classification and characterization of the life cycle impact assessment. In this paper, the {LCA} study was found as a very helpful tool to define ecodesign measures for this product. Several measures are suggested to the manufacturers to implement the ecodesign in the future: 1) Use recyclable plastics in the minor parts and hidden components, such as switcher, handle etc.; 2) Reduce the number of different materials in packaging; 3) Avoid incompatible plastics during recycling; 4) Minimize the volume of the heat plate on the premise of meeting the rated heating power.},

The methods discussed are (1) {1D} tolerance charts, (2) variational analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation, (3) vector loop (or kinematic) based analysis, and (4) {ASU} T-Maps©  based tolerance analysis. Tolerance charts deal with tolerance analysis in one direction at a time and ignore possible contributions from the other directions. Manual charting is tedious and error-prone, hence attempts have been made for automation. Monte Carlo simulation based tolerance analysis is based on parametric solid modeling; its inherent drawback is that simulation results highly depend on the user-defined modeling scheme, and its inability to obey all Y14.5 rules. The vector loop method uses kinematic joints to model assembly constraints. It is also not fully consistent with Y14.5 standard. {ASU} T-Maps based tolerance analysis method can model geometric tolerances and their interaction in truly 3-dimensional context. It is completely consistent with Y14.5 standard but its use by designers may be quite challenging. T-Maps based tolerance analysis is still under development. Despite the shortcomings of each of these tolerance analysis methods, each may be used to provide reasonable results under certain circumstances. No guidelines exist for such a purpose. Through a comprehensive comparison of these methods, this paper will develop some guidelines for selecting the best method to use for a given tolerance accumulation problem.},

Tolerances specify allowable uncertainty in dimensions and geometry of manufactured products. Due to these characteristics and application of tolerances, it is necessary to create a math model of tolerances in order to build a computer application to assist a designer in performing full {3D} tolerance analysis. Many of the current efforts in modeling tolerances are lacking, as they either do not completely model all the aspects of the {ASME/ISO} tolerance standards or are lacking the requisite full 3-D tolerance analysis. Some tolerance math models were developed to suit {CAD} applications used by the designers while others were developed to retrofit the {ASME/ISO} tolerance standard. Three math models developed to retrofit the {ASME/ISO} standard, tolerance-maps, deviation domain, and {TTRS} are the main focus of this paper. Basic concepts of these math models are summarized in this paper, followed by their advantages and future issues. Although these three math models represent all aspects of the {ASME/ISO} tolerance standard, they are still lacking in one or two minor aspects.},

	abstract = {In this paper, groups of individual features, i.e., a point, a line, and a plane, are called clusters and are used to constrain sufficiently the relative location of adjacent parts. A new mathematical model for representing size and geometric tolerances is applied to a point-line cluster of features that is used to align adjacent parts in two-dimensional space. First, tolerance-zones are described for the point-line cluster. A Tolerance-Map®  (Patent no. 69638242), a hypothetical volume of points, is then established which is the range of a mapping from all possible locations for the features in the cluster. A picture frame assembly of four parts is used to illustrate the accumulations of manufacturing variations, and the T-Maps®  provide stackup relations that can be used to allocate size and orientational tolerances. This model is one part of a bilevel model that we are developing for size and geometric tolerances. At the local level the model deals with the permitted variations in a tolerance zone, while at the global level it interrelates all the frames of reference on a part or assembly.},

	abstract = {A new mathematical model for representing the geometric variations of a planar surface is extended to include probabilistic representations for a {1D} dimension of interest, which can be determined from multidimensional variations of the planar surface on a part. The model is compatible with the {ASME/ANSI/ISO} Standards for geometric tolerances. Central to the new model is a Tolerance-Map®  (T-Map® ) (Patent No. 6963824), a hypothetical volume of points that models the {3D} variations in location and orientation of a feature, which can arise from tolerances on size, position, orientation, and form. The {3D} variations of a planar surface are decomposed into manufacturing bias, i.e., toward certain regions of a Tolerance-Map, and into geometric bias that can be computed from the geometry of T-Maps. The geometric bias arises from the shape of the feature, the tolerance-zone, and the control used on the mating envelope. Influence of manufacturing bias on the frequency distribution of {1D} dimension of interest is demonstrated with two examples: the multidimensional truncated Gaussian distribution and the uniform distribution. In this paper, form and orientation variations are incorporated as subsets in order to model the coupling between size and form variations, as permitted by the {ASME} Standard when the amounts of these variations differ. Two distributions for flatness, i.e., the uniform distribution and the Gaussian distribution that has been truncated symmetrically to six standard deviations, are used as examples to illustrate the influence of form on the dimension of interest. The influence of orientation (parallelism and perpendicularity) refinement on the frequency distribution for the dimension of interest is demonstrated. Although rectangular faces are utilized in this paper to illustrate the method, the same techniques may be applied to any convex plane-segment that serves as a target face.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews four major methods for tolerance analysis and compares them. The methods discussed are: (1) one-dimensional tolerance charts; (2) parametric tolerance analysis, especially parametric analysis based on the Monte Carlo simulation; (3) vector loop (or kinematic) based tolerance analysis; and (4) {ASU} Tolerance-Map® (T-Map®) (Patent pending; nonprovisional patent application number: 09/507, 542 (2002)) based tolerance analysis. Tolerance charts deal with worst-case tolerance analysis in one direction at a time and ignore possible contributions from the other directions. Manual charting is tedious and error prone, hence, attempts have been made for automation. The parametric approach to tolerance analysis is based on parametric constraint solving; its inherent drawback is that the accuracy of the simulation results are dependent on the user-defined modeling scheme, and its inability to incorporate all Y14.5 rules. The vector loop method uses kinematic joints to model assembly constraints. It is also not fully consistent with Y14.5 standard. The {ASU} T-Map® based tolerance analysis method can model geometric tolerances and their interaction in truly three-dimensional context. It is completely consistent with Y14.5 standard but its use by designers may be quite challenging. The T-Map® based tolerance analysis method is still under development. Despite the shortcomings of each of these tolerance analysis methods, each may be used to provide reasonable results under certain circumstances. Through a comprehensive comparison of these methods, this paper will offer some recommendations for selecting the best method to use for a given tolerance accumulation problem.},
