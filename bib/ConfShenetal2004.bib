	abstract = {This paper reviews four major methods for tolerance analysis and compares them. The methods discussed are (1) {1D} tolerance charts, (2) variational analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation, (3) vector loop (or kinematic) based analysis, and (4) {ASU} T-MapsÂ©  based tolerance analysis. Tolerance charts deal with tolerance analysis in one direction at a time and ignore possible contributions from the other directions. Manual charting is tedious and error-prone, hence attempts have been made for automation. Monte Carlo simulation based tolerance analysis is based on parametric solid modeling; its inherent drawback is that simulation results highly depend on the user-defined modeling scheme, and its inability to obey all Y14.5 rules. The vector loop method uses kinematic joints to model assembly constraints. It is also not fully consistent with Y14.5 standard. {ASU} T-Maps based tolerance analysis method can model geometric tolerances and their interaction in truly 3-dimensional context. It is completely consistent with Y14.5 standard but its use by designers may be quite challenging. T-Maps based tolerance analysis is still under development. Despite the shortcomings of each of these tolerance analysis methods, each may be used to provide reasonable results under certain circumstances. No guidelines exist for such a purpose. Through a comprehensive comparison of these methods, this paper will develop some guidelines for selecting the best method to use for a given tolerance accumulation problem.},
