<h2>ASME Computers in Information and Engineering Division</h2>

<h1>2012 Graduate Research Poster Submission</h1>

<p>An opportunity for graduate students early in their research program (within 1 year of starting a MS or 2 years of starting a PhD) to present their current work to the research community. This provides the students a chance to get external feedback on their preliminary research that may not yet be ready for presentation at the conference in archival form.</p>
<p><b><i>Travel support is available!</i></b></p>
<p>The ASME CIE Division is organizing a poster session for graduate students to present their current research at the ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference in Chicago, IL, USA August 12 – 15, 2012. The purpose of this poster session is for graduate students early in their research program (within 1 year of starting a MS or 2 years of starting a PhD) to have the opportunity to present their current work to the research community. This provides the students a chance to get external feedback on their preliminary research that may not yet be ready for presentation at the conference in archival form.</p>
<p> The research should directly address computers and information in engineering, either through development of new software, application and evaluation of software, or empirical studies of engineering software. Areas of CIE interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer-Aided Product and Process Development</li>
<li>Systems Engineering</li>
<li>Information and Knowledge Management</li>
<li>Advanced Modeling and Simulation (Computational Multi-physics Applications, Inverse Problems in Science and Engineering, Energy Systems)</li>
<li>Virtual Environments and Systems</li>
<li>Product Lifecycle Management</li>
<li>Modeling Tools and Metrics for Sustainable Manufacturing </li>
<li>Prognostics and Health Management</li>
<li>Enterprise-wide Information Management</li>
<li>Network-Centric Product Realization</li>
<li>Emotional Engineering</li>
<li>Agent-Based Modeling</li>
<li>Emerging Computational Methods for Engineering Design</li>
<li>Knowledge-Based Engineering</li>
</ul>
<p><H2>
Important Dates</H2></p>
<p>Submission of abstract and application for travel support: 	<b>May 02, 2012 </b><br>

<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Student and Advisor Contact Information</li>
<li>Abstract of the Work</li>
<li>Research Motivation</li>
<li>Research Questions and Hypotheses</li>
<li>Description of the Work to Date</li>
<li>Description of the Path Forward</li>
<li>Lessons Learned</li>
</ul>
<p>The size of the poster should be about 71.11 cm (W) x 91.43 cm (H). Only one page is allowed. The poster templates can be downloaded below.</p>

<h2>CIE Student Travel Support and Stipends</h2>
<p>The CAPPD committee of the ASME Computers and Information in Engineering (CIE) division and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are offering travel support and stipends to support graduate student attendance at the 2012 CIE conference in Chicagon, IL to present a poster on their research. Travel support in the amount of $1000 each will be awarded by NIST to cover the awardees cost of travel to and accommodation at the conference. Students pursuing doctoral research will be given priority for these awards. Four smaller stipends of $250 are also available to help offset the increasing costs for attending the conference. These are open to any graduate student. Poster submissions reflecting relevant and high quality research work will be favored in the awarding process.</p>
<p>To apply for these awards interested students should submit the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A written statement explaining how the applicant’s research is relevant to any of the technical areas within the CIE division and how attending the conference will benefit the applicant’s on-going research and career goals.</li>
<li>A travel budget clearly showing estimated expenses, other sources of funding for the trip and how the award/stipend bridges the shortfall between the two.</li>
<li>A letter from the student’s research advisor confirming the student’s eligibility, other sources of funding for travel to the conference and supporting the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>This application must be submitted together with the abstract and other information as requested in the call for posters electronically to the poster session organizer (<a href="mailto:gameta@wsu.edu">gameta@wsu.edu</a>) by the abstract submission deadline. To be eligible for a travel award or stipend interested students must be attending a university or college in the United States during the 2012 CIE conference and be a registered student member of ASME. NIST travel award recipients must be US citizens.</p>
<p>Applications will be evaluated based on the quality of the research abstract and the written statement submitted. Successful applicants will be informed of the committee’s decision by May 27th 2012. Travel awards will be disbursed through travel arrangements made by NIST’s travel office on behalf of the awardees. Stipends will be presented at the CAPPD committee meeting at the conference.</p>
<p><strong>*Awardees of both the NIST travel support and stipends are required to attend this meeting as a condition of the award.</strong></p>
